Home repository for the dataset introduced in [ACORN: Aspect-wise Commonsense Reasoning Explanation Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04818).
ACORN contains 3,500 human-written and LLM-generated explanations with aspect-wise quality ratings given by humans. 

Also available on ðŸ¤—HuggingFace [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/anab/ACORN)!

# Data
The entire dataset is contained in `ACORN.jsonl`. Each row consists of an explanation, related information, aggregated (majority-voted) ratings, and the full set of individual worker ratings. 

Basic fields:
- `question` question text
- `choices` list of answer choices
- `label` correct answer index
- `explanation` explanation text
- `supports`, `overall`, `well_written`, `related`, `factual`, `new_info`, `unnecessary_info`, `contrastive` majority-voted ratings
- `worker_ratings` all worker ratings, saved as a dictionary of dictionaries (worker id â†’ rating dict).

â†’ See [Additional fields](#additional-fields) for the full list of fields.

# Quality aspects
Explanation quality is subjective and can depend on the intended use. Our choice includes both a *general* rating and *fine-grained* aspects of explanation quality assuming an ideal of **fluent**, **sufficient**, **minimal**, and **contrastive** explanations.

# Sources
ACORN contains a blend of explanations from several sources. See Section 2.2 in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04818) for a more detailed overview.

![ACORN contains samples from ECQA, CoS-E, COPA-SSE, generated explanations for Commonsense QA, generated explanations for Balanced COPA, newly collected explanations for Balanced COPA, and GPT-3.5 edited versions of CoS-E and COPA-SSE. Each group has 500 samples, totaling 3500 samples.](/readme/Data_sources.png)
